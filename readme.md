# Robustness of Reinforcement Learning

## 0. Introduction

This is a project for studying the robustness of reinforcement learning controllers in classical control problems, for 
instance the Cart-Pole problem.  

## 1. Initialising the environment

The reinforcement learning environment for this project is [Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/), and the deep learning
platform is Pytorch.  

Install requirements packages:  
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## 2. Running a Demo
